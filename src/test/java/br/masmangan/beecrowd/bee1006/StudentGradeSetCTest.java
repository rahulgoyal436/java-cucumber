================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If this setter method is used in a web application, and the value of 'c' is passed through a GET request, it could potentially expose sensitive information through logs or browser history.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive data through GET requests. Use POST requests instead or encrypt the data before sending.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The method does not validate or sanitize the input 'c'. If 'c' is used in a security decision, this could lead to vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs. Do not trust user inputs blindly. Implement checks for the range, type, format, and length of input data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the setter method is used for debugging purposes and is not removed in the production environment, it could potentially expose sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure to remove all debug codes or guard them using conditional directives before deploying the application to production.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test setting a positive value for c

Details:
  TestName: testSetPositiveC
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setC correctly sets the value of c when a positive number is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the setC method with a positive double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of c has been updated to the passed argument.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method setC accurately updates the value of c. The test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle and correctly processes positive input values.

Scenario 2: Test setting a negative value for c

Details:
  TestName: testSetNegativeC
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setC correctly sets the value of c when a negative number is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the setC method with a negative double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of c has been updated to the passed argument.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method setC accurately updates the value of c. The test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle and correctly processes negative input values.

Scenario 3: Test setting a zero value for c

Details:
  TestName: testSetZeroC
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method setC correctly sets the value of c when zero is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
    Act: Invoke the setC method with zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the value of c has been updated to zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method setC accurately updates the value of c. The test is significant as it ensures that the method can handle and correctly processes zero as an input value.
