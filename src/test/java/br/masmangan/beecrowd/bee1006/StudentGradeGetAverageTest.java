================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The code is using double for arithmetic operations. This can lead to precision errors and unexpected results, especially when dealing with large numbers or when the precision of the outcome is critical.
Solution: Consider using BigDecimal or BigInteger for arithmetic operations when precision is crucial.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not check whether the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c' are null before performing operations on them. This can lead to a NullPointerException.
Solution: Before performing operations on objects, always check that they are not null. This can be done by adding a null check like 'if (a != null)' before using 'a'.

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
Issue: The current method does not have any access control or security checks. It can be accessed and used by any other method, which can lead to unintended behavior or misuse.
Solution: Consider adding access control mechanisms, like making the method private or protected, and only allowing trusted, authorized methods to call it.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test getAverage method with positive numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetAverageWithPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getAverage method by using positive numbers for a, b, and c variables.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a, b, and c variables with positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAverage method correctly calculates the average of a, b, and c variables with their respective weights. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula used in the method. This test is significant in ensuring the functionality of the getAverage method.

Scenario 2: Test getAverage method with negative numbers

Details:
  TestName: testGetAverageWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the getAverage method by using negative numbers for a, b, and c variables.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a, b, and c variables with negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAverage method correctly calculates the average of a, b, and c variables with their respective weights, even when the numbers are negative. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula used in the method. This test is significant in ensuring the functionality of the getAverage method under different conditions.

Scenario 3: Test getAverage method with zero

Details:
  TestName: testGetAverageWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the getAverage method by using zero for a, b, and c variables.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a, b, and c variables with zero.
  Act: Invoke the getAverage method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected average.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAverage method correctly calculates the average of a, b, and c variables with their respective weights, even when the numbers are zero. The expected result is based on the mathematical formula used in the method. This test is significant in ensuring the functionality of the getAverage method under different conditions.
